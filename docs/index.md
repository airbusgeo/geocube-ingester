# Geocube-Ingester

Geocube-Ingester is an example of an automatic and parallel ingester for the [Geocube](https://github.com/airbusgeo/geocube).
It is provided either as a generic framework for Geocube ingestion or as an example to develop new ingesters.

From an AOI, a time interval and a set of parameters (to configure the output layers), the ingester takes care of everything from the downloading of the products, the computing, its parallelization and the ingestion in the Geocube.

It currently supports Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Pl√©iades and SPOT and it's designed to easily add new sources of data or satellites using the [interfaces](architecture/interfaces.md).

Dockerfiles are provided to do automatic preprocessing of images using **user-defined SNAP-Processing graphs**, **python script** or **docker commands**.
