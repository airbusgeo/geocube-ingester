# Getting started

This quickstart requires [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you don't have a Geocube Server running, you can start one, with docker-compose, following these [instructions](https://geocube-database.readthedocs.io/en/dev/installation/docker-install/#docker-compose). Here the quickstart is configured for a geocube server running on localhost:8080, without apikey.

- Clone `https://github.com/airbusgeo/geocube-ingester.git`.
- Start geocube-ingester service with docker-compose, following [these instructions](installation/docker-install.md#docker-compose).

The ingester is running and waiting for your instructions !

Then, you can do the [tutorial](user-guide/tutorials.md) to learn how to use the ingester.
