# Payload

The input of the ingester is a payload. It contains an AOI, a date interval, parameters defining the raw products, parameters defining the processing and parameters defining the products to be ingested in the Geocube.

The payload is a GeoJSON (all fields are mandatory unless otherwise stated):

- **AOI** according to GeoJSON standards (type, geometry, coordinates...)
- **name**: Unique name used to identify the Area in the workflow. After a first ingestion, new scenes can be added to the same area, benefiting from automatic scenes reference picking (useful for S1-bursts).
- **start_time**, **end_time**: date interval
- **scene_type**: describing the type of the products to be downloaded
    - **constellation**: Name of the Satellite Constellation (currently supported : sentinel1, sentinel2)
    - **parameters**: (optional) specific parameters to filter the results (see [Catalogue API guide](#catalogue-apis))
- **scene_graph_name**: name of the graph that will be used just after downloading the scene (or "CopyProductToStorage") (see [Processing Graphs](graph.md))
- **tile_graph_name**: name of the graph that will be used to process each tiles (or "Pass") (see [Processing Graphs](graph.md))
- **graph_config**: (optional): specific configuration of the graphs
- **layers**: mapping between layers to be indexed in the Geocube and the corresponding variable.instance from the Geocube (see Geocube Documentation).  
    - **layername**: {"variable":"variable_name", "instance":"instance_name"}
- **record_tags** (optional): user-defined tags for identifying/creating the record in the Geocube.

## Inputs

In ingestion payload, `geometry`, `start_time`, `end_time` and `scene_type` are mandatory in order to list available scenes covering by AOI and between range of time.

### Sentinel1

We need to use `scene_graph_name` in order to extract every bursts from Scenes. This step is processed in downloader as pre-processing (1 job per Scenes).

`tile_graph_name` defines processing to use for every Tiles. This step is processed after downloading every Scenes (processor) (1 job per Tiles).

### Sentinel2, SPOT, PHR

We need to use `scene_graph_name` in order to pre-process data (example: extract Panchromatic & MultiSpectral Image from DIMAP product).

`tile_graph_name` defines processing to use for every Scenes/Tiles. This step is processed after downloading every Scenes (processor).

cf. [Payload ingestion](payload.md#example)

## Catalogue APIS

### Scihub

See Scihub [API guide](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/userguide/WebHome)

### OneAtlas

OneAtlas available parameters: 	`productType`,`platform`,`processingLevel`,`cloudCover`, `incidenceAngle`, `workspace` and `relation`

NB: To use other parameters or mix different kind of imagery. You need to group all your images in the same workspace (via OneAtlas) and reference only `workspace` in payload ingestion.

For more information see: [OneAtlas API guide](https://www.geoapi-airbusds.com/api-catalog/oneatlas-data/index.html#tag/Search)

## Utilities

- `Geometry`, `scene_type`, `end_time` and `start_time` will be useful for catalog in order to search corresponding scenes.
- `scene_graph_name` will be useful for pre-processing in downloader (example: extract every burst from scenes) in order to define which graph will be used.
- `tile_graph_name` and `graph_config` will be useful for  processor in order to define which graph will be used.
- `record_tags` and `layers` will be useful in workflow in order to create potential record in Geocube and reference existing variables and instances (for the indexation of the data).

## Endpoints

The Area, with scenes and tiles, is posted to the workflow service that is in charge of creating and running the processing flow.

### Tiles Payload

```shell
curl -F "area=@{payloadFile}" -F "tiles=@outputs/tiles.json" -H {token} {workflow_server}/catalog/aoi
```
Example of tiles.json: [here](monitoring.md#tiles)

### Scenes Payload

```shell
curl -F "area=@{payloadFile}" -F "scenes=@outputs/scenes.json" -H {token} {workflow_server}/catalog/aoi
```
Example of scenes.json: [here](monitoring.md#scenes)


### AOI Payload

```shell
curl -F "area=@{payloadFile}" -H {token} {workflow_server}/catalog/aoi
```
